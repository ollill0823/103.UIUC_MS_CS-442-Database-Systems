### Data file:
- [Flight Delays and Cancellations in the USA](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11ZzNzQQLywrrOj0_A4Rksx0I5l-8rBPW?usp=sharing) Raw data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays)
- The data we will be using consist of flight delays and cancellations from 2015 published by the DOT's Bureau of Transportation Statistics. We will extract IATA_code, airport, city, state, departure delay, and dates from the three CSV files of flight information. We plan on utilizing geographical data (airport, city, state, etc) to aid in the construction of our map, and other statistics (such as departure time, weather delays, cancelations, etc) to create our own tables, rankings, and predictions.
